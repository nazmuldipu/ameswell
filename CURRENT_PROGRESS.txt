Current Agenda
- need to get responsiveness for the slider on index page
- need to test with videos
- need to put slider on rest of pages
- need to apply slider behavior to room carousel
- need to get slider content right
- test
- merge

NEW CAROUSEL DESIGN
- for image galleries will only have single caption -- so don't need to sync with images
    - hopefully this will make the responsiveness issue go away
- for Room carousel, single image with <room-title> + <room-description> pairs that have slider behavior


LATER
- possibility of caption per image
- move away from Splide to proprietary Web Component based solution
