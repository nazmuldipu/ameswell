Currently
--- need to position the nav element in the carousel
--- however, can not position it relatively given: caption and slide architecture
--- Solution ideas
    --- break caption outside of the Splide track and then use JS to load (e.g. data-splide-caption?)
        --- downside is losing ability to flip through with caption / have nice caption transition automatically
            --- can Splide handle this? 
                --- A) Maybe through "sync" and another slider -- but then would have slides with no images
                    --- would also need to hide the arrows [done]
                    --- need numbers to sync on image "drag" event...
                    --- need buttons to not have highlighted outline -- some extra margin / padding for pressing would be good too
                --- B) what about use of Splide Extensions (e.g. Splide caption)? Would then have to define transitions
POSSIBLY USEFUL SPLIDE FEATURES
    --- 
    --- absolutely position nav
        --- would have to be with reference to picture, and picture would then have to have a priori known height
            --- height would need to be known at different breakpoints...


--- How can I access Components? -- e.g. Drag...
MAIN ISSUE -- how to get 'drag' in navigational Component to effect an appropriate 'move'?
emit a move event?

--- the silence of being the navigational Component messes things up...
